Q1=Criteria 1\: Product comparability
Q11=1.1 Valid for a single product
Q12=1.2 Valid for several products with variation below 10%
Q13=1.3 Valid for products with variation above 10%
Q14=1.4 Valid for a product or several products where variation is not defined"
Q2=Criteria 2\: Manufacturing representativeness
Q21=2.1 Valid for a single manufacturing site
Q22=2.2 Valid for several manufacturing sites from the same company with variation below 10%
Q23=2.3 Valid for several manufacturing sites from the same company with variation above 10%
Q24=2.4 Valid for a manufacturer or manufacturers products where variation is not defined
Q3=Criteria 3\: Data accuracy
Q31=3.1 Specific data for > 90%
Q32=3.2 Specific data for > 80%
Q33=3.3 Specific data for > 60%
Q34=3.4 Specific data not defined
Q4=Criteria 4\: Third party review type
Q41=4.1 Certified EPD according to EN 15804 and ISO 14025
Q42=4.2 Self-declared environmental declaration based on certified EPD\:s according to EN 15804 (i.e. categorised as 4.1) that contributes to at least 90% of the GWP100 indicator result A1-3, or an environmental declaration made as copy of an already published EPD made from an LCA tool that is verified and the only possible change by the end user is the product recipe.
Q43=4.3 Third part verified LCA that complies with EN 15804 and ISO 14021 and made transparent via a public available LCA report and Q metadata report
Q44=4.4 Any other third party verified EPD according to ISO 14025 but not according to EN 15804, or any other self-declared LCA result not published by a   program operator but following EN 15804 and not made transparent via an LCA report. Q metadata has to reported for this category
Q5=Criteria 5\: Additional documentation specifications
Q51=5.1 Allocation procedure applied where a by-product is not attributed to any impact?
Q52=5.2 Inherent properties are allocated away and do not reflect the physical flows?
Q53=5.3 System expansion applied?
Q54=5.4 Recycling of a technosphere flow is handled with non-symmetry
Q55=5.5 EPD is not based on core process data from the actual manufacturing site
Q56=5.6 The inventory for the core process is less than 1 year
Q57=5.7 Impact on climate change (GWP result) includes biogenic carbon dioxideemissions that are not reported separately, or it is not possible with information in the EPD to separate GWPGHG and GWPbio.(biogenic CO2 emission and uptake and stored carbon in the product)
Q58=5.8 Not all mandatory environmental indicators are reported?
Q59=5.9 Any other assumption made?
Q6=Criteria 6\: Q metadata validation
Q61=6.1 The same verifier as for the EPD and part of the verification procedure
Q62=6.2 Any other third party verifier with access to underlying information
Q63=6.3 Self claim by the company responsible for the EPD
Q64=6.4 Any other external LCA-expert without access to underlying information
